#Importance of Cleanliness

Sanitation and neatness play an important role in our day to day routine. 
It is important as it prevents dangerous diseases like Dengue, typhoid, hepatitis, and other diseases caused by mosquito bite, etc.

Diseases like Jaundice, Cholera, Ascariasis, Leptospirosis, Ringworm, Scabies, Schistosomiasis, Trachoma, etc can be spread due to eating contaminated food, drinking contaminated water or living in an unhygienic condition. 
Trash also spread bad odour which is difficult to tolerate. 
There will also be an accumulation of trash and dirt if clean measures arenâ€™t taken.
